          Information Element for Flow Discard Classification
            draft-evans-opsawg-ipfix-discard-class-ie-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a new IPFIX Information Element for classifying
   flow-level discards which aligns with the information model defined
   in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-discardmodel].  The flowDiscardClass Information
   Element provides consistent classification of packet discards across
   IPFIX implementations, enabling correlation between device and
   interface-level statistics and impacted flows.

1.  Introduction

   For network operators, understanding both where and why packet loss
   occurs within a network is essential for effective operation.  While
   certain types of packet loss, such as policy-based discards, are
   intentional and part of normal network operation, unintended packet
   loss can impact customer services.  To automate network operations,
   operators must be able to detect customer-impacting packet loss,
   determine its root cause, and apply appropriate mitigation actions.

   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-discardmodel] addresses this need by defining an
   information model that provides precise classification of packet
   loss, enabling accurate automated mitigation.  While its YANG data
   model implementation provides device, interface and control-plane
   discards, effective automated triage often requires understanding
   which specific flows are impacted.  For example, when mitigating
   congestion, operators may need to identify and trace the sources of
   elephant flows.  This requires the ability to correlate device and
   interface-level discard classes with the specific flows being
   dropped.

   Currently, [RFC7270] defines the forwardingStatus Information Element
   for reporting packet forwarding outcomes in IPFIX, including various
   reasons for packet drops.  The defined drop reason codes lack the
   granularity and clarity needed for automated root cause analysis and
   impact mitigation, however.  For instance, the "For us" reason code
   provides insufficient context to determine appropriate mitigation
   actions.

   This document addresses these limitations by introducing a new
   Information Element, flowDiscardClass, to provide a consistent
   classification scheme for packet discards across IPFIX
   implementations.  This new element aligns with the classification
   scheme defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-discardmodel] and enables:

   1.  Precise detection of unintended packet loss through clear
       distinction between intended and unintended discards

   2.  Accurate root cause analysis through detailed classification of
       discard reasons

   3.  Automated selection of mitigation actions based on discard type,
       rate, and duration

   4.  Consistent reporting across vendor implementations in both YANG
       and IPFIX data models

   By providing this mapping between YANG and IPFIX implementations,
   this document enables operators to correlate device-level statistics
   with flow-level impacts, facilitating more effective automated
   network operations.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   A packet discard accounts for any instance where a packet is dropped
   by a device, regardless of whether the discard was intentional or
   unintentional.

   Intended discards are packets dropped due to deliberate network
   policies or configurations designed to enforce security or quality of
   service.  For example, packets dropped because they match an Access
   Control List (ACL) denying certain traffic types.

   Unintended discards are packets that were dropped, which the network
   operator otherwise intended to deliver, i.e. which indicates an error
   state.  There are many possible reasons for unintended packet loss,
   including: erroring links may corrupt packets in transit; incorrect
   routing tables may result in packets being dropped because they do
   not match a valid route; configuration errors may result in a valid
   packet incorrectly matching an ACL and being dropped.

   Device discard counters do not by themselves establish operator
   intent.  Discards reported under policy (e.g., ACL/policer) indicate
   only that traffic matched a configured rule; such discards may still
   be unintended if the configuration is in error.  Determining intent
   for policy discards requires external context (e.g., configuration
   validation and change history) which is out of scope for this
   specification.

3.  Information Element

   This Information Element has been specified in accordance with the
   guidelines in [RFC7013].

3.1.  Design Rationale

   The mapping between [I-D.ietf-opsawg-discardmodel] and the IPFIX
   flowDiscardClass Information Element follows these principles,
   maintaining consistency with the YANG model while allowing self-
   contained decoding from a single IE

   1.  The flowDiscardClass Information Element is specifically for
       reporting flow-level discard reasons, and therefore only
       represents the flow subtree from [I-D.ietf-opsawg-discardmodel].
       The component is implicitly "flow" and the type is implicitly
       "discards"; interface, device, and control-plane components are
       out of scope for this IE.

   2.  All leaves under flow/discards are assigned codes, and aggregate
       (parent) nodes are also assigned codes to enable coarse-grained
       rollups.

   3.  To preserve the information model’s hierarchy, the code space
       includes structural aggregates under flow/discards/l2 and
       flow/discards/l3, and for L3 the address-family and cast
       aggregates l3/{v4,v6}/{unicast,multicast}.

   4.  Exporters and collectors MAY continue to use existing IPFIX IEs
       (e.g., flowDirection, ipVersion, addresses, ipDiffServCodePoint)
       for filtering, correlation, or redundancy, but flowDiscardClass
       alone suffices to recover the discard classification.

3.2.  flowDiscardClass Definition

   Name: flowDiscardClass

   Description: Classifies the reason a packet was discarded in a flow,
   using the hierarchical classification scheme defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-discardmodel].

3.3.  flowDiscardClass Values

   Table 1 defines the values for the flowDiscardClass Information
   Element mapped from the corresponding [I-D.ietf-opsawg-discardmodel]
   Discard Class.  The codepoints for flowDiscardClass are maintained by
   IANA in the "flowDiscardClass Values" subregistry of the IPFIX
   registry.  Future additions or changes are managed via Expert Review
   as described in Section 5.

              Table 1: Flow discard classification values and
                       corresponding discard classes

   Codes are assigned in preorder (depth-first) tree order to reflect
   the model’s hierarchy. no-buffer/class conveys per-QoS class
   congestion loss; the specific class (e.g., DSCP/class index, or L2
   PCP) SHOULD be exported via the appropriate companion IE in the same
   record.

3.4.  Usage with Existing Information Elements

   flowDiscardClass enumerates all leaf and aggregate nodes under flow/
   discards so that a collector can recover the full classification from
   this IE alone, with the exception of traffic class.

   Per-class congestive loss (no-buffer/class): When reporting no-
   buffer/class, the specific traffic class (e.g., DSCP or L2 PCP)
   SHOULD be carried in a companion IE (e.g., ipDiffServCodePoint,
   ipClassOfService, or dot1qPriority) in the same record;
   flowDiscardClass itself remains an identifier only, consistent with
   [RFC7013] separation of condition vs. parameters.

   Multiplicity: Exporters MUST NOT encode multiple discard reasons in a
   single instance of flowDiscardClass.  If multiple reasons apply,
   export multiple records (one per reason) or use IPFIX Structured Data
   (e.g., a basicList of flowDiscardClass values) per [RFC6313] and
   [RFC7013].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a new Information Element for flow-level
   discard classification to align with the information model defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-discardmodel].  As such, there are no security
   issues related to this document, which are additional to those
   discussed in [RFC7011], [RFC7012].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the flowDiscardClass
   Information Element in the IANA IPFIX Information Elements registry.

   IANA is requested to make the following actions in the IP Flow
   Information Export (IPFIX) Entities registry:

   1.  Register the flowDiscardClass Information Element.

   2.  Create a new subregistry: "flowDiscardClass Values":

       Registry: under IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Entities

       Registration Procedure: Expert Review [RFC8126]

       Reference: this document; [RFC7013]

       Fields:

       *  Value (integer)

       *  Name (path under flow/discards/...)

       *  Description (optional)

       *  Reference

       Initial contents: the values in Table 1 (codes 0..38).

       Allocation policy guidance to the Designated Expert(s): New
       values should reflect additions to or clarifications of the
       discard reasons in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-discardmodel] (or its
       successor) and must not repurpose existing codepoints.
       Backwards-compatible additions are preferred; revisions to
       existing entries should follow [RFC7013].

Appendix A.  Correlating Flow Discards with Interface/Device Discards

   This section gives non-normative guidance for correlating flow-level
   discard reporting (this document) with interface and device discard
   aggregates exported via [I-D.ietf-opsawg-discardmodel].  The goal is
   to enable operators to correlate device and interface-level discard
   classes with the specific flows being dropped.

A.1.  Correlation Keys

   Collectors SHOULD correlate records along the following axes:

A.1.1.  Device / Observation Domain

   The observationDomainId (IPFIX message header) binds Flow Records to
   the same Exporter/Observation Domain as the device-level or
   interface-level counters.

   The observationPointId (IE 138) can disambiguate between multiple
   observation points on a device (e.g., line card/port pipeline).
   Exporters MAY also include lineCardId (IE 141) and portId (IE 142) to
   improve stability across interface renumbering.

A.1.2.  Interface Context

   Exporters SHOULD include ingressInterface (IE 10) and/or
   egressInterface (IE 14) in Flow Records carrying discard information,
   so that flow-level drops can be grouped to the same interface
   hierarchy used by the discardmodel.  Note that values correspond to
   ifIndex semantics and may be reassigned on reboot.

A.1.3.  Time Alignment

   When Flow Records represent an interval, use IPFIX time IEs to align
   with the window of the discardmodel counters:

   *  flowStart/flowEnd timestamps (e.g., millisecond-precision
      variants) and/or

   *  observationTime{Seconds,Milliseconds,Microseconds,Nanoseconds} for
      event-style exports

   Collectors SHOULD perform windowed joins (e.g., within the Flow's
   start/end bounds) when aggregating flows to interface/device
   counters.

A.1.4.  Discard Class

   This draft's flowDiscardClass values index the leaf and aggregate
   classes defined by the discardmodel, including L2 and L3 aggregates.
   Correlation is therefore a direct match on the class identifier.

A.2.  Recommended Exporter Behaviour

   To facilitate accurate correlation, an Exporter that sets
   flowDiscardClass for a Flow Record:

   *  SHOULD also export ingressInterface/egressInterface and
      observationPointId in the same record/template.

   *  SHOULD export time bounds (flowStart/flowEnd) or an
      observationTime* timestamp appropriate to the reporting model.

   *  SHOULD include counters that quantify the drop, such as
      droppedOctetDeltaCount (IE 132) and droppedPacketDeltaCount (IE
      133), when available, alongside this draft's class indicator, so
      that the per-class volume can be rolled up to the interface/device
      aggregates.  (For L2 counters, the corresponding IEs such as
      droppedLayer2OctetDeltaCount (IE 424) apply.)

   *  MAY include lineCardId/portId when interface renumbering is common
      in the deployment.

   These recommendations follow [RFC7013] guidance to keep identifiers
   and semantics precise, avoid ambiguity about scope, and provide
   sufficient context to interpret counters correctly.

A.3.  Correlating to Discardmodel Components

   The discardmodel organizes counters under three components:
   interface, device, and control-plane, with traffic and discards
   subtrees, per direction and class.

   A collector can:

A.3.1.  Interface-level Correlation

   Group Flow Records by (observationDomainId, observationPointId?,
   ingressInterface/egressInterface, flowDiscardClass) over the chosen
   time window and sum dropped-packet/byte deltas.  Compare to the
   discardmodel's per-interface, per-direction, per-class counters in
   the corresponding time bucket.

A.3.2.  Device-level Correlation

   Repeat the above grouping without the interface keys (sum over all
   interfaces), and compare to device-level aggregates in the
   discardmodel.

A.3.3.  Control-plane Correlation

   Where applicable, correlate Flow Records whose flowDiscardClass
   indicates control-plane policy/actions with the discardmodel's
   control-plane subtree.  (Exporters may additionally use forwarding
   status IEs when relevant; see [RFC9710] updates to the IPFIX
   registry.)

A.4.  Handling Expected Discrepancies

   Differences between summed flow-level drops and interface/device
   aggregates are expected when:

   *  Different observation points (e.g., pre- vs post-feature stages)
      are used; observationPointId and observationPointType can explain
      such gaps.

   *  Sampling or filtering is applied to flows but not to device
      counters.

   *  Clock skew / windowing causes boundary effects; prefer aligning to
      observationTime* if flows are very short.

   Exporters SHOULD document (or export via Options) any sampling,
   filtering, or pipeline placement that affects visibility, per
   [RFC7011]/[RFC7012] operational guidance.
